# ANN
Artificial Neural Network, an algorithm inspired by natural neural networks (human brain), consists input, output layer and hidden layers. The input layer sends information to the second layer, the second to the further layer and an output is determined. The out put is compared with the actual output and the weight on layers is adjusted depending on how much the margin of error is.
